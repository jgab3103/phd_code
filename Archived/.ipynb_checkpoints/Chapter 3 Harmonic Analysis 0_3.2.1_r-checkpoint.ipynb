    "# <h1>Chapter 3 Harmonic Analysis</h1> <p class=\"phd_quote\">'Here's Miles,\"[Wynton Marsalis says and sings a phrase by Miles Davis].  \"I would say, \"Damn, why did he play like that? Here's 'Trane [Marsalis sings a passage by John Coltrane]. \"Trane's playing just the exact opposite. Why is 'Trane playing like that? When you are just learning jazz, everything is mystical\"(Berliner, 34).</p>  <p>This quote above is taken from the opening pages of Peter Berliner's landmark study on jazz improvisation and highlights the critical problem of jazz improvisation: it is not clear what jazz improvisation really is. When musicians improvise in jazz, on some level decisions are being taken that result in certain notes being heard at certain times. Yet the reasons behind these decisions often remain unclear. Jazz musicians will often claim that they 'have no idea what [they] are going to do when they take a solo'(Berliner, 66). The mystical process of jazz improvisation is further complicated by musicians improvising jazz but sounding different to each other. Consider John Coltrane's choice of notes and construction of melodic phrases compared to Miles Davis, when they both played solos on Davis' 1958 record, <u>Kind of Blue</u>. Yet both solos are regarded as somehow being jazz.</p>       <p>The ambiguity that surrounds jazz improvisation also presents challenges to musicians who are trying to learn their craft. What kind of things should they practice? What note is appropriate to play at any given time? The jazz education landscape is littered with instructional texts that will often highlight the importance of playing certain notes from certain scales, or playing notes that are contained in the harmonic progressions that are being improvised over. But when looking at note choice in jazz solos, this clearly not what is going on, or at least not the complete story. Jazz musicians and educators alike will often also say that improvisation is also supposed to be spontaneous. There should be no preconception when about what is to be played. So how does the aspiring jazz musician seek to train him or herself to have no preconceived notion of what to play? As well as this almost mystical side to jazz improvisation there might also be best called the craft of being a jazz musician: the practical skills that are expected in any ensemble situation. Professional jazz musicians are expected to know thousands of jazz standards in any key, and expected to know the idiomatic things that often happen in these jazz standards. They are expected to be able to play at fast tempos and employ specific rhythmic patterns that are idiomatic of the genre. So how does a jazz musicians work in such a prescriptive environment but at the same time be somehow spontaneous?</p>  <p>This chapter and the next will analyse what note choices are being made when Keith Jarrett when he improvising on a range of jazz standards. The purpose of the analysis is not to try and discover whether there is, or is not, some kind underlying preconception or underlying philosophy. Instead it is to understand when certain notes are chosen for Jarrett and if there is any structure to this. Part of the motivation for the analysis is to provide an insight into the practical issues faced by jazz musicians seeking to understand which notes are appropriate and when they are appropriate. </p>      <p>The analysis in this dissertation is completely data-driven. It examines the notes in the solos and the order which they are played. The analysis makes it possible to examine the harmonic progressions of these jazz standards with a view to understanding these progressions influence note choice. Each standard also has a main melody (being the main melody of the song written by the composer). This makes it possible to ascertain if there is a relationship between the main melody and the note choices in the solo. In this chapter, the focus will be on how individual chords and harmonic progressions can influence note choice. The following chapter will look at the ways in which series of notes are joined together to create melodies and these phrases.</p>      <p>The data set that informs this analysis will show that, even in Keith Jarrett's solos where no single phrase is ever repeated across the entire corpus (extremely unusual even for a jazz musician), there is rich and deep structure to be found. Not only does this shed light on how consciousness mediates creative decision making, but also makes it possible set the foundational of a model that can do this.</p>       <p>The benefit of taking a data-driven approach to the analysis is that it becomes possible to take everything into account, to discover nuanced contexts in which note choices are being made, and how often these contexts occur. It becomes feasible to interrogate any note in the data set to understand when it might and might not occur, and even attach a quantitative probability to this. While it may be feasible however, there also practical limitations that come with this approach. Therefor, this this chapter will take an in depth analysis of only the dominant seventh chord and explore how this chord influences note choice, and this choice changes depending on the chord's context. To be thorough, appendix 2 also shows the design of a search engine that users can use to examine when notes occur in what situations which a wide variety of parameters including different chords and tempos and a working version of the search engine can be found <a href=\"#\"> here.</a></p>"

There are 7858(<i>MARK! - this will grow to 20k notes, just working with the smaller data set at the moment</i>) rows of data, each representing a note in one of the ten Keith Jarrett's solos under investigation. At such a high level it may seem that there is not much of a conclusion to be drawn here. But even here there are valuable insights to be found. For example, although at any one time in any given solo there are 88 notes that could possibly be played (being the notes found on piano), Jarrett only utilises 48 of these (being between Db3 and F6). Additionally, some notes are utilised far more than others. The table below (Table 3.x) lists, in descending order, each note (here denoted by its midi frequency) and the amount of times it appears in the data set. Underneath this is a statistical summary of the data. A C5 is the most common note to be found in Jarrett's solos.</p>"

Table 3.x below shows a normalised distribution of the different chord types which can also be visualised in Figure 3.x. The dominant seventh is the most common chord type, and if the trend in the-data set holds for jazz standards broadly, this suggests something interesting for aspiring jazz improvisor: it makes mores considerably more sense to spend time learning how to improvise on dominant chords, because they will be the ones that most often are played.</p>"

The data-set shows that, on average, the number of notes played on a dominant chords is significantly higher than the number of notes played on any other chord type. This means that Jarrett plays more densely playing on a dominant chord. Table 3.x below shows a comparison between the proportion of dominant chords in a particular standard and the proportion of notes in the solo that are played over the dominant chords standard. The conclusion that can be drawn here is that, not only does the dominant chord occur more often in this data-set, but more notes in the solo are played when it does occur.</p>"

    "<p>Chapter 5 will show that the dominant chord is in fact far more ubiquitous the above figures suggest. Jarrett, like many other jazz musicians, will often superimpose the notes of a dominant chord (in arpeggio form) on the other chords types and this notion (called reharmonisation) will be examined in detail in that chapter.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>For the aspiring jazz pianist, this cursory examination of the data-set presents some useful insights: solos should take place in a limited range on the piano; the range will be more limited at the beginning of solo; notes used in the solos have a relationship to notes found in the harmonic progressions; when a dominant chord is played, soloing should be more dense than at other times. However there are also significant limits in examining the data at this level. To look more deeply at the structure of these solos, I will examine the dominant seventh chord type in the following section, in order to explore the context in which note choices are made.</p>"

    "<p>Table 3.x below lists each degree (regardless of the root note of the dominant chord) and the number of times Jarrett plays it when a dominant seventh chord occurs in a harmonic progression within the data-set. This immediately challenges the view that often arises in jazz instructional materials, that the correct notes to play on a dominant seventh chord should belong to a particular scale, or some kind of subset of notes in the octave. The data-set shows that in fact, all 12 notes in an octave can be played on a dominant seventh chord. The table below also challenges another view commonly seen in jazz instructional texts: that chord tones (in particular thirds and sevenths) should be played most often. Here it is actually the fifth degree (for example the a G5 on a C dominant seventh chord) that is actually the most common choice of note to play in a solo, followed by the root degree.</p>\n"

    "<p>Although the data-set can clearly establish that any note can be be played when soloing over a dominant seventh chord, it is important not to draw the conclusion that this somehow suggests any note is permissible in jazz improvisation under investigation here, or that improvised melodies are the result of some kind of musical free-for all. Often when talking of jazz, there is even a kind of folklore that strengthens this view. Miles Davis claimed, \"Do not fear mistakes, there are none\". Herbie Hancock claimed, \"Jazz is about being in the moment\". Regardless of what such sentiments might mean, the evidence from this data will show that jazz is not an anything-goes art-form. There is a deep and subtle framework governing note choice to be found here, one that speaks directly to the human ability to make context based decisions in linear time, that reflect a balance between repetition and variety.</p>\n",

    "<p>The figures above suggest that the root degree is not used in an indiscriminate fashion. The data-set shows that there are in fact very strict constraints in place around exactly how the root degree is to be prepared and resolved when used on a dominant chord. For example it is far more likely that the root note will be prepared from either a semitone above (for example a Db5 leading to a C5 on a C dominant seventh chord) or from two semitones below (for example a Bb5 leading to a C5 on a C dominant seventh chord) and far less likely it will be prepared from a 4 semitones below (for example an Ab4 leading to a C5 on a C dominant seventh chord). Conversely, It is not at all possible to prepare the root note from 6 semitones above (for example, an F#5 leading to a C5). Although the F# if commonly regarded as a viable note choice for improvisation on a dominant seventh, if the root degree is played, it is not permissible given this data-set to use an F# beforehand.</p>"

    "<p>Table 3.x shows a closer view of the data which focuses not only on the use of the root degree, but also its most common preparation: from a semitone above (for example a Db5 leading to a C5 on a C dominant seventh chord). There are 72 instances in total where this happens. The table also lists a count of the different ways the root note is then resolved. It shows that overwhelmingly this resolution will be to either to two semitones below or to one semitone below (together there is a 65% chance that one of these outcomes will occur). This can be compared with the likelihood that the root note will resolve to a note 4 semitones below (for example a Db5 leading to a C5 leading to Ab4 on a C dominant seventh chord) which is only 6.9%.</p>\n",

However, there is deeper story here. The data-set begins to show that there is in fact repetition, and a great deal of it. When the melodic phrases in this data set are broken into 3-note structures (being the preparation note, the note under investigation, and the resolution note) repetition begins to emerge.</p>\n",

Table 3.x below also reveals a long tail of different ways to resolve (here being to a note four semitones below, through to a note 19 semitones below), each of which is not very likely in itself. It is this long tail of exceptions which allows the variety to be part of the solos and I will show that the exceptions are actually linked the main melody of the jazz standard on which the solo is being played.</p>"

    "<p>These examples are not only the same in terms of the thee notes passage they use. The data-set can yield other important pieces of information too. The use of this three-note structure happens only in passages where notes are of the same duration (i.e. all eighth-notes or quarter-notes). There are many instances in the data set where Jarrett plays far more freely with the time, (for example of playing groupings of five or seven notes and playing notes of different duration within the one phrase). In particular, at at slower tempos, this figure does not occur. The data-set also shows that there is no bias in terms of which particular root degree is chosen. Finally, Jarrett never uses this three-note structure in the first part of the bar and there is over a 90% chance that the root degree will on the beat when this three-note structure is used.</p> "

    "<p>It is worth pausing for a moment and considering just what this type of analysis has allowed us to do. Consider that one of the issues jazz musicians face, especially when they are first learning: the problem of not being able to play things that 'sound like jazz', even though they are using notes that are regarded as appropriate. The type of analysis being undertake allows musicians to go to take a far more nuanced approach. It shows that it is not about finding an appropriate note that might be played or which scale has the right notes, but rather about finding the correct placement of this note and the surrounding notes, and to easily see numerous examples. For aspiring jazz musicians, this type of analysis allows a just-in-time approach to learning how to improvise.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This analysis also shows that, if it is possible to set the context and scope carefully in order to apply right kind of lens to the data, things start to become predictable. The exploration above has allowed us to find out that, if the root degree is played on a dominant chord, there is a 25% chance it will have been preceded by a note that is a semitone above. If that is the case, there is then a 30% chance it will be resolved to a note that two semitones below. If all of these things happen, then there is then a 100% chance that the notes are taking place in the middle to latter part of the bar, that they are in a passage of notes is equal duration, and a 90% chance the root degree will be on the beat. Having these kinds of probabilities being attached to this data opens the way to creating a sophisticated generative music model, which will be taken up in chapter 5.</p> "

    "<p>There are of course far more marginal things happening in this data-set in regard to how the root degree on the dominant seventh is used. Still considering the root degree being prepared from a semitone above, there is then only a three percent chance that it will then resolve up three semitones (only two instances in the entire data-set). It is worth investigating these to ascertain if there is something underlying this marginality. The first example is seen in Figure 3.x from <u>If I Were A Bell</u>. It shows the root note on a C dominant seventh leading to a Eb5. Intuitively, this three-note structure seems to arise as part of the requirements of the repetitive diatonic sequence (a very rare thing for rare for Jarrett to do). The usual behaviour of the root degree being prepared by a semitone above has been undermined by the requirements of the sequence.</p>"

    "<p>The other example of the root degree being prepared from one semitone above, and then resolved to three semitones upwards, can be seen below in Figure 3.x. It occurs on an F dominant seventh chord. The data-set shows that it is extremely rare for Jarrett to play in the range around F3 where this example is taking place. A possible explanation for this marginal case is perhaps then related to the usual playing range of Jarrett's improvisations. In any case, what both of these examples suggest is that there are other factors in play here, other than the calculation of probabilities around three-note structures. The use of repetitive motifs (no matter rare they might be) and the practicalities of where the right hand is playing on the piano,both appear to have some (albeit limited) bearing on note choice. In the following chapter I will take up these issues in more detail but the point to make here is that the marginal preparations and resolutions do not occur for simply no reason: there are influencing factors driving all of these decisions.</p> "

    "<p>It is possible to invert the approach we have been taking toward this analysis. Rather than focusing just on the different types of preparations, it is possible to examine the data-set from the point of view of the resolutions of the root degree, to explore what kind of preparations they are likely to have. Table 3.x below shows a summary of those cases where the root degree is resolved to a note that is two semitones above (for example a C4 note being followed by D4 note on a C dominant seventh chord), and all of its possible preparations. The resolution to two semitones above is not common, but particularly interesting as it shows the use of a natural ninth (the D4 resolution note in the example) being used on a dominant chord. The natural ninth is not usually cited as an ideal note choice for a dominant chord and most instructional texts will instead favor the use of the sharp or flat ninth as they appear in scales choices more often associated with the improvising over the dominant chord (such as the altered scale).</p>"

    "<p>The use of the ninth degree will be taken up in more detail in a later section, but what is interesting to note here (and this holds for all of the examples) is that when this three-note structure is used, it is part of of a diatonic passage (using the scale of Eb Major in the example above and the scale of Bb Major in the example below). A major scale (or any other scale) is an arbitrary sctructure, a cultural construct though is often used to explain or explore music theory (Vanderlay, 98). Although the data-set completely invalidates the notion that note choices are being driven by scales, scalar passages do still emerge. The data-set shows that the major scale is employed as an idiomatic device in some phrases of the solos. The use of the root degree in conjunction with a preparatory note two semitones below and and a resolution note two semitones above, usually being found within larger phrases is shows this this idiomatic device at work. A second example of this can be seen in the second bar of the excerpt below in Figure 3.x at the end of the second bar.</p>"

    "<p>Before moving on to the various uses of the fifth degree on the dominant seventh, one further example will be considered. This can be seen in Figure 3.x. below. Although the first bar of this example is taking place on an F dominant seventh, the melodic phrase is far more typical occur on a minor seventh chord (in this C minor chord). A possible reason for this is that the II-V-I progression is ubiquituous in the solos and jazz more generally. So the notes of a II chord will often be super-imposed on the first part of the bar of the V chord. This is a typical device used in jazz, a kind of super-imposition of the sound of one chord on an other. This device is often called reharmonisation and in Chapter V we will explore how Jarrett uses this in more detail.</p>  "
