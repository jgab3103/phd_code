<p>Chapters 3, 4 of the thesis will focus on different aspects of analysing Jarrettâ€™s solos with a view to ascertaining why particular notes may be chosen in particular musical situations. The analysis will also reference an analtyical framework outlined below. Although the framework will draw up on firmly established tenents of music theory (such as the importance of voice-leading and harmony constructed in thirds), these are here presented as features of the dataset. This includes the notions that: 1) jazz based is full of idiomatic chord progressions which are interchangeable; 2)voice-leading or step-wise motion between notes in a solo (moving up and down a tone or semitone) is a widespread feature; 3)arpeggio patterns built in thirds are also very common and; 4)The placement in relation to the beat of a note in he solo significantl indicator of note choice</p>

<h4>2.3.1 Idiomatic Chord Progressions are ubiquitous in jazz</h4>
<p>When examining both the dataset and looking more widely towards jazz standards, its  it is evident that in the notes of the harmony there is much repetition. Progressions such as the IImin7-Vdom7-Imaj7 (figure X) or IIImin7-bIIIdim7-IImin7 are appear numerous times. </p>
